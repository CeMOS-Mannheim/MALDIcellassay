\arguments{
\item{spec}{List of MALDIquant::MassSpectrum}

\item{dir}{Character, directory for output}

\item{conc}{Numeric vector, concentration for each spectrum. Length has to be the same as length of spec}

\item{unit}{Character, unit of concentration. Used to calculate the concentration in Moles so that pIC50 is correct.
Set to "M" if you dont want changes in your concentrations.}

\item{varFilterMethod}{Character, function applied for high variance filtering. One of the following options `mean` (default), `median`, `q25`, `q75` or `none` (no filtering).}

\item{monoisotopicFilter}{Logical, filter peaks and just use monoisotopic peaks for curve fit.}

\item{averageMethod}{Character, aggregation method for average mass spectra ("mean" or "median")}

\item{normMz}{Numeric, mz used for normalization AND for single point recalibration.}

\item{normTol}{Numeric, tolerance in Dalton to match normMz}

\item{alignTol}{Numeric, tolerance for spectral alignment in Dalton.}

\item{binTol}{Numeric, tolerance for binning of peaks.}

\item{SNR}{Numeric, signal to noise ratio for peak detection.}

\item{allowNoMatches}{Logical, if normMz can not be found in a spectrum, proceed and exclude spectrum or stop}

\item{normMeth}{Character, normalization method. Can either be "TIC", "PQM", "median" or "mz". If "mz" then the normMz is used. If none no normalization is done.}

\item{saveIntensityMatrix}{Logical, save the intensity matrix as xlsx to the disk.}

\item{SinglePointRecal}{Logical, perform single point recalibration to normMz}

\item{fc_thresh}{Numeric, threshold for fold change above which curves are plotted. The fold-chage is calculated as max/min for a given m/z.}

\item{markValue}{Numeric, value to mark in the resulting plot. Set to NA if no value needs to be marked.}

\item{plot}{Logical, should the curves be plotted and written to dir?}
}
\value{
Object of class `MALDIassay`.
The most important slot is `fits` which contains the IC50 curve fits.
